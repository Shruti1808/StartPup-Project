  "description": "<p>Palaeoplushies are my range of scientifically accurate dinosaur soft toys.</p><p>I design them myself, reconstructing them based off of the latest palaeontological knowledge. My hand-made soft toys are designed and painted digitally, printed onto fabric and then cut out and sewn personally. I also sell a range of products designed by myself.</p><p>I've sold them mainly online, but I do occasionally frequent palaeontology conferences to sell my soft toys.</p><p>Recently, due to high demand and inability to keep up with orders, I was motivated to get one of my toy designs produced professionally. I ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to get a feathered Velociraptor mongoliensis manufactured! Thanks everyone for your support!</p>",
